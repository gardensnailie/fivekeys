The Hunters' Guild in the city of [[Dis]] is a professional and quasi-religious order responsible for the training, outfitting, and deployment of hunters who are tasked with containing the spread of [[Tenebris]] and defending the region from shade-touched creatures. Its employees, known simply as hunters, are both revered and pitied -- seen as heroes protecting the innocent and as expendable tools in a fight no one believes they can win.

### Operations
Hunters serve multiple purposes, both within the city's ecosystem and in the surrounding area:
- Tracking and eliminating shade-touched creatures, as well as infected humans who have reached end stages of Tenebris and have begun to mutate into monstrous forms.
- Securing contaminated areas and containing outbreaks to prevent the further spread of Tenebris, often in conjunction with [[Inquisitors]].
- Participating in months-long campaign in the attempt of establishing further settlements.
- Recovering dangerous or valuable goods and relics from ruins outside the city, or within [[Dis#Shade-Touched|quarantined districts]].

Hunters operate primarily outside of the city, as a counterpart to Dis' [[Inquisitors]], who are more suited to work in heavily populated areas. The two organizations are in frequent contact with one another, and rely on cooperation daily. A typical hunting party demands the presence of an Inquisitor, due to their ability to purify the remains of hollows.

All hunters are trained rigorously to track and combat corrupted beings and creatures, handle relics safely, and to recognize the early signs of Tenibris in both humans and animals.

##### Weapons and Armor
Common weapons include axes, spears, and other simple forms of easily-repairable arms -- these are often made of reclaimed metals and materials. Bows and crossbows are particularly uncommon as they are unsuited for the climate. [[Pathomancy|Pathomancer]] hunters may instead choose to make use of relics that compliment their abilities; these can include anything from physical armaments that channel or strengthen various elements, to more specific items that aid in various tasks. All hunters are provided access to [[Pathomancy#Vitae|vitae]]-fueled lanterns that they are capable of perpetually fueling using any form of vitae-bearing substance, including pathomancy.

Due to the [[Dis#Geography & Architecture|climate]], most hunters choose to make use of local animal pelts and furs in the creation of their armor -- which itself is often comprised of gambesons and multi-layered padded armors. Helmets are often worn for warmth more than protection.

Various species of shade-touched beasts are capable of producing extraordinary materials with which to craft after being purified that are much more durable than conventional hide or metal; it is common that a hunter's armor and weapon eventually be comprised of monsters which the hunter themselves have slain. 

##### Fjordhawks
The organization maintains the use of Fjordhawks, a species of predatory bird used to transmit messages. Trained to roost at the Hunter's Guild in Dis, it is considered either a magnificent triumph or a grave disaster to see one make its return without its accompanying falconer. These birds are thusly associated heavily with the organization symbolically.

### Rituals and Beliefs
Despite being very pragmatically-minded, hunter culture is heavily influenced by ritual, and often blends them together. The life of a hunter is deeply fatalistic; most accept that they will either die in the field or succumb to corruption. But it is the grim determination they embrace their role with despite such facts that gives the guild its sense of comradery.

- It is customary to etch protective glyphs into weapons, believing these marks to bind the shade and make increase damage. 
- Likewise, as a symbolic defense against corruption, hunting parties often rub bone ash on their skin, or use pigments made of such as face and body paint drawn in specific patterns to invoke different virtues or enhance specific attributes. 
- In some cases, hunters may draw small amounts of blood to smear on the blades of their weapons to imbue them with the vitae from within their body.
- Hunters carry salt or ash made of purified hollow remains on their person at all times; when injured, it is consider best practice to immediately treat the wound by rubbing either into the area to prevent the spread of Tenibris.
- After returning from a mission, hunters carve the names of fallen comrades  and those slain onto bone effigies to be displayed in guild halls as memorials to the dead.
- Hunters who die during hunts are often ritually cremated or partially dismembered to prevent reanimation.

### Hunters in Society
While hunters are indispensable to the regions surrounding Dis, they occupy a precarious and unsteady place amongst Dis' culture. Hunters are lauded and admired for their bravery, and have been the subject of song and folklore for years -- however, due to their association and close contact with Tenibris, most live lives isolated from other citizens. It is common for hunters to reside in the guild hall itself, or one of several isolated lodges, in order to avoid conflict with the greater population. 

##### Shade-Touched
Many hunters are, themselves, in various states of infection, and may find that the guild is one of the few places in broader society that they are welcomed. Infected individuals often seek out the organization looking to join in order to gain access to the guild's incumbent pathomancers and medical professionals for treatment. Hunters, in turn, are often the most sympathetic and willing to engage with the infected.

Tenibris is the leading cause of non-combat death amongst hunters due to their prolonged exposure and high-risk lifestyle; to some, this is seen as a fate worse than death, and there are many tales of hunters disappearing into the wilds for one final hunt they do not plan to return from.

### Notes
- Hunter membership is predominantly male; pathomancers and inquisitors, however, see a fairly even split between genders.
