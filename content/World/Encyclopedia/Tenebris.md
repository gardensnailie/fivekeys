Tenabris, colloquially known as being *Shade-Touched*, is a terminal, progressive disease. Characterized by cellular corruption, it is known to cause systemic failure and, in advanced cases, extreme physical mutation. Infected cells are overtaken by a parasitic substance dubbed *anti-vitae* by academics - this substance is considered an antithesis tot he life-essence present in all living things, and leads to widespread biological degeneration.

The presence of anti-vitae in corpses often leads to reanimated bodies known as "hollows," which lack consciousness and function as carries for the propagation of the disease.

Tenebris is considered incurable. Despite treatment existing to slow the progression, there is no known way to reverse or halt the disease entirely. This has led to widespread fear, misunderstanding, and discrimination against infected.

###### Physiology
The cornerstone of Tenebris' functioning is its parasitic nature, which replaces healthy cells over time. Early stages often manifest as shard- or scale-like growths thought to be a result of localized cellular crystallization. These growths appear both within and outside of the body, often forming scale-like patterns on the skin or, in more advanced cases, even creating larger extraneous structures that resemble spikes, horns, or plating.

As the disease progresses, it affects the nervous system, causing sensory loss (ex. blindness, deafness), personality changes from brain compression, and symptoms similar to aggressive cancers. 

In terminal stages, Tenebris culminates in catastrophic mutations as the body's cellular structure is completely overtaken by these parasitic structures, which result in rapid physiological changes ranging from mundane to monstrous. 

Those who are afflicted with the disease will often be reanimated after death, acting as mindless hosts for the propagation of the disease.

###### Symptoms
The severity of Tenebris is categorized into several identifiable stages, dictated largely by the imposition on one's day-to-day life and the response to conventional medical treatment:
- **Stage One:** Internal crystalline growths, localized pain, low-grade immune responses (mild fever, fatigue, etc.), and mild unexplained weight loss or gain. 
- **Stage Two:** Crystalline growths become external; symptoms are often similar to stage one infections but with higher severity. Pain may begin to spread to other locations. 
- **Stage Three:** Loss of sensory functions, behavioral changes, bone pain, shortness of breath, cold sweats, seizures and dizziness, loss of expected autoimmune responses (ex. wounds that do not heal), loss of appetite. 
- **Stage Four:** Physical mutations or abnormalities may begin to appear as crystalline or fleshy growths; extremely heightened aggression, uncontrollable hunger, systemic failure of various bodily functions, skin loss, and hemorrhaging.
- **Stage Five:** Death, or complete mutation into a hollow.

###### Treatment
There is no known cure for Tenebris. Instead, treatment focuses on slowing disease progression and alleviating symptoms. Common interventions include:

- Experimental medications intended to delay the spread of anti-vitae, predominantly comprised of unusual, vitae-rich substances or other materials with essence absorbent properties.
- Removal of anti-vitae from the body via practices such as blood-letting and preemptive amputation of affected body parts.
- Pathomancers are capable of removing large quantities of anti-vitae; however, it often results in the pathomancer themselves taking the substance into their own bodies. These forms of treatment are widely unavailable and condemned.
- Symptom management (e.g., pain relief, sensory aids).

Despite these measures, prognosis is grim; most patients succumb to the disease or its mutations within years of diagnosis.

###### Transmission
While Tenebris is not widely considered contagious under normal circumstances, it is often treated as such by the general public due to lack of awareness, as well as the potential for area-wide contamination. Upon death, the anti-vitae present in the body "leaks" into the surrounding environment in search of vitae to sustain itself, leading to the rapid infection of nearby individuals.

Direct transmission is relatively rare and typically requires specific conditions, due to anti-vitae quickly becoming inert when separated from vitae for more than a few minutes. As such, peer-to-peer infection is often in the form of direct transfusion of infected fluids and unsanitary pathomantic practices.

###### Body Disposal
When an infection individual dies, the anti-vitae collected within their body rapidly spreads in the immediate area in search of more vitae with which to sustain itself. Because of this, there are various forms of disposal policies developed by a variety of settlements meant to responsible dispose of infected bodies:

-  Designated "dying areas," often made of inert materials such as stone and metal, may be used for end-stage palliative care of the infected. These locations are kept free of anything Tenebris may spread to; after death, the individual is left undisturbed for several days to allow the anti-vitae to die, before the now-inert body is buried.
- Remote locations may be used for the storage of the deceased; though the anti-vitae within the dead will often decimate the immediate locale and leave it uninhabitable. For this reason, areas such as caves, pits, and ravines are often preferred.
- Pathomancy maintains the unique ability to manipulate anti-vitae by drawing it towards themselves. Some societies enlist the use of Pathomancers to "purify" the dead, at the cost of their own wellbeing.
- Various forms of cremation remain popular in a wide variety of locations, although there is little proof that this is an effective strategy in dealing with anti-vitae infection.

###### Social Effects
Those afflicted with Tenebris are heavily stigmatized, often viewed as pariahs or walking time bombs. Small settlements frequently banish infected individuals to avoid the risk of local contaminations, while larger cities may have policies explicitly to manage shade-touched populations. However, due to the dangerous nature of the disease and inevitability of mutation, euthenasia is a grim but standard policy in many regions. Those who reach a critical stage of progression are often forcibly quarantined or euthanized to prevent he risk of reanimation or transformation in hollows.

Locations such as Dis have designated specific districts as quarantine zones for the infected. These areas serve both as containment zones and communities for the afflicted. Many shade-touched choose to relocated to these districts voluntarily, as they offer a degree of autonomy and freedom from regular monitoring and stigma.

Many authorities choose to maintain unofficial truces with these zones, allowing them to remain largely unmonitored so long as they comply with local law and do not pose a broader threat. Because of this, such districts often maintain significant criminal population, which furthers the negative stigma of these communities.

###### Misc.
- The shade-touched are a frequent subject in folklore, often portrayed as tragic figures or harbingers of various disasters, as well as a metaphorical representation of other issues. These stories have contributed largely to the fear and ostracization of those with Tenebris.
