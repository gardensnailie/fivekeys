The manipulation of life energies through the channeling of one's strongest emotional state. At certain pivotal points of a person's life, profound and consuming emotions may "anchor" to their body, allowing them to use it as a conduit to access the magic associated with that emotion. This magic is fundamentally tied to life force

### Vitae

All living things possess **vitae**, a form of life force or energy. This energy is responsible for animation; like energy, it cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred between forms and vessels. As it is responsible for the vitality of living things, it is most often condensed and transported via blood and other analogous biological systems.

### Pathomancy

Pathomancy is the manipulation of vitae through the channeling of strong emotional states. 

Extreme or profound experiences may concentrate vitae within the body to such high concentrations that it is capable of being manipulated and used to manifest various forms of magic. By re-experiencing these strong emotions, Pathomancers are capable of drawing upon these powers at will. The strongest emotions create the most potent forms of magic, but conversely demand the highest tolls from their users, both physically and mentally.

Because their magic is based on the concentration of vitae, Pathomancers regularly make use of their own blood as a physical conduit, resource, or sacrifice. On rare occasions, one's emotional state may be so heightened that this becomes unnecessaryâ€”however, such high concentrations of vitae within the body can have adverse side effects and are often extremely dangerous.

All forms of Pathomancy can be categorized into five primary emotive types, known as *genres*. 

###### Joy
The rarest form of Pathomancy, and often considered the ideal genre. Pathomancers who draw from Joy are most frequently seen within academic and domestic settings, as they often find difficulty in maintaining a joyous disposition in the face of battle... unless, of course, that is what they draw their joy from.

###### Tranquility
A largely passive form of Pathomancy, tranquility has been the focus of many studies in recent years due to its status as the most "learnable" genre. Whilst this is, indeed, a large boon to many, the reality is that such profound levels of inner peace may leave such Pathomancers with little interest in pursuing grander goals that may make use of their talents.

###### Sadness
Perhaps the most palatable of the negative genres, sadness is unfortunately also one of the most common. Pathomancers of this genre are often most equipped to handle continuous, extended uses of their abilities - but tend to suffer the most from the psychological toll of re-experiencing their past.

###### Fear
Fear Pathomancy is predominantly protective or defensive in nature, and Pathomancers of this genre may find it more difficult to expand their repertoire of abilities. The one notable exception to this is when drawing from feelings of *disgust* - although scholars argue over whether this belongs in the genre of fear or anger.

###### Anger
By far the most common genre amongst hunters, anger-based Pathomancy is known to be especially hard on the body. Forms of scarring and self-injury from its explosive and powerful nature are particularly common, and its taxing nature makes various other forms of health complications much more likely than in other genres.
