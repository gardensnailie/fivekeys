Inquisitors are the city of Dis' internal officers who are tasked with the management of [[Tenebris]], the infected, and its quarantined districts. Composed entirely of [[Pathomancy|pathomancers]], Inquisitors operate with a chilling authority that sets them apart from the [[Hunters]] -- their outbound counterpart. Feared as both necessary protectors and harbingers of death, Inquisitors serve as the last line of defense against an enemy that cannot be fully understood or eradicated.


### Operations
Inquisitors seek to maintain the safety of the uninfected within the city of Dis. Their duties are grim -- and their methods, while effective, are deeply controversial:
- Inquisitors conduct routine inspections in suspected outbreak zones and amongst high-risk populations in order to identify individuals showing early signs of infection and submit their information to local monitoring programs.
- They oversee the enforcement of forced relocation to quarantined districts, ensuring that any sufficiently affected individuals are not permitted to enter the general populations or access the uninfected.
- In cases of end-stage Tenebris, Inquisitors carry out state-mandated euthenasia. They are likewise tasked with handling mutations and outbreaks within city limits, often with the aid of [[Hunters|hunters]].
- In the aftermath of outbreaks, attacks, and deaths in non-quarantined areas, Inquisitors purify infected remains, cleanse the surrounding areas, and prevent the spread of anti-vitae.
- Hunter parties mandate the presence of an Inquisitor in order to minimize the impact of slaying the corrupted.

##### Abilities
The pathomantic abilities of all inquisitors allow them to cleanse anti-vitae from both the living and dead by directing it towards themselves. This is one of the only known ways to "dispose" of anti-vitae before it is inert, and is what grants inquisitors the ability to purify remains and prevent the spread of infection. While all pathomancers are theoretically capable of this, inquisitors are unique in that they are trained specifically for this purpose, and thus are capable of not only manipulating anti-vitae, but are also adept at sensing its presence.

While inquisitors are unusually equipped for this task, the intake of anti-vitae means that infection with Tenebris is inevitable. All inquisitors bear some stage of the disease; as such, the lifespan of an inquisitor once they begin field work is often only a few years.

Inquisitors also maintain other pathomantic abilities in much the same way other pathomancers do; the exact details of which are highly variable depending on the individual. 

##### Artificial Pathomancy
Many inquisitors are what is known as "artificial pathomancers" -- that is, someone whose pathomancy was purposefully induced. The exact procedure through which this is done is not widely known; however, it has an exceedingly high failure rate, and artificial pathomancers are often unstable, both physically and mentally. 

##### Weapons and Tools
- In addition to their pathomancy, inquisitors carry a series of relics that are seemingly capable of resonating with anti-vitae and aid in its identification. 
- Inquisitors carry on their person vials of concentrated vitae -- this serves as fuel for their pathomancy, draws anti-vitae to them, and can be used in emergency situations as a form of healing.
- Upon initiation, inquisitors are given individualized body markings that are believed to protect against the long-term effect of anti-vitae and aid in pathomancy. Some are bone ash pigmentation painted onto the skin, while some are permanent tattoos -- it's unknown what the difference between these is, if there is one at all.
