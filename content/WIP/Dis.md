Dis is the largest occupied settlement; a sprawling city settled in the appropriated ruins of a past civilization. Deeply spiritual and ruthlessly pragmatic, it serves as a haven for the majority of the surviving population in the region. 

It is home to the Hunters Guild, an organization of individuals whose purpose is to eradicate those who have been consumed by the shade, retrieve lost artifacts, and prepare areas for resettlement.

## Geography & Architecture
Located within the tundra steppe, Dis is a large, walled, multi-tiered city with architecture that is primarily built upon the ruins of the second era. It is surrounded on all sides by low hills, moraine ridges, and low-lying rivers and lakes. 

Dis and the surrounding area reside nearly 500ft above sea level; winters are long and cold with temperatures averaging around 0°F, with short and cool summers nearing 45-50°F. It receives relatively low amounts of rainfall. To the east is a large-tundra-forest, and the west is the sea.

##### Architecture
Due to the area largely being bereft of wood, the majority of its buildings have been repaired using a combination of stone, brick, salvaged materials, and animal products like bone and hide. Homes and buildings are overly-spacious and often comprise of a mixture of architectural styles. Intricate murals, statues and glyphs meant to ward off corruption are common, and the decorative style reflects a cultural preoccupation with the virtues and their eidolons.

The city is divided into distinct zones:
- Core districts comprised of wealthy neighborhoods. Dominated by relic-powered purification systems, these areas encompass elaborate ceremonial spaces, estates for the upper-class, and well-established public institutions such as educational centers.
- Middle districts are bustling hubs of trade and craft, filled with markets and taverns. This is where the majority of residents live, in crowded, busy streets. The most important area of the middle districts are long its shared border with the core districts -- this is where both the Hunters Guild, as well as most hospitals and places of worship, may be found.
- Outer districts are povertous, and is also where the city's designated containment zones for infected lay. These are outside of city walls, with architecture that is much newer than within the city proper, as most buildings have been constructed rather than repurposed.

## Society & Culture

##### Upper Class
The upper class of Dis is defined largely by meritocratic practices. These positions within society are much more volatile than one would expect, and it is not unusual to see entire families rise and fall in status and wealth within the span of a generation. Accomplished warriors, academics, politicians, pathomancers, and those profoundly touched by virtues consist of the most common heads of estate. 

The elite possess a culture preoccupied with the idea of corruption and purification, and many rituals and practices have arisen throughout Dis as part of this. This includes ritual bathing and the decoration of homes and bodies with protective symbols. Incense burning is also a common practice among the wealthy, as is the ownership and usage of old-world relics as status symbols.

Estates of the well-established are the only houses whose family names are known and used on a regular basis -- to use one's family name is self-reverential, and otherwise considered a social faux paus.

Current established estates of note include:
- **The Ashikagas**. Notable for being one of the few ethnic minorities within Dis' population, the family traces their notoriety to the late Junpei Ashikaga, a scholar on the topic of pathomancy. It is currently entrusted to its current head-of-house Shouta, and his sons Tenha and Akihiko.

##### Lower Class
Middle and working class individuals make up the bulk of Dis' occupancy, and is the bed of the city's pragmatic worldview. Like is defined by hard work and solidarity -- as such, most individuals are known by their professions and deeds as much as they are their given names. Similarly, the grim determination of Hunter culture has seeped into the social strata as a whole.

- Symbols of renewal are common in all forms of iconography, most often represented by a broken ring or circle. 
- Dis practices ritual tattooing as a way to ward off infection and to recount past deeds, largely in the form of old-world runes and evocations of virtues. This practice has waned in recent years due to the spread of Tenebris and growing knowledge on how it is spread, and is now largely relegated to hunters.
